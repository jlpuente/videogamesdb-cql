This repository includes all our source files (**source** folder) and code (**code** folder) in order to deploy our database. The process is explained in the documentation within **doc** folder. 

**Important**: I used the latest image of Cassandra Docker fetched from [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra).
